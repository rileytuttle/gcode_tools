should split out the circle arc objects into a new file/folder called path primitives
then we pass them the gcode writer so they can take care of their own logi

gcode writer should only be concerned with writing the lowest level of stuff
so the actual Gcode commands
for instance the arc path and goto functions can stay in gcode writer but the other methods that don't directly write gcode should move out to the path primitives
